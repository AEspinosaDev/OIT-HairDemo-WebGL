# OIT-HairDemo-WebGL
WebGL Order Independent Tansparency Technique tailored for hair cards

+ Currently implementing layered approach, presented in this 2019 paper: https://graphics.tudelft.nl/Publications-new/2021/FEE21/layered_weighted_blended_order_independent_transparency.pdf
+ Original WBOIT paper: https://jcgt.org/published/0002/02/09/
+ Inspiration and reference from: https://github.com/tsherif/webgl2examples/blob/master/oit.html 

No need for npm install, project needs a few very light packages and it's all already included for the sacke of simplicity.

Shading is bad, this project only focus in on transparencies for now. Might add a modified Kajiya's shading in the future just for a good visual ref.
